# Auto-scaling Group w/ Rolling Deploys

This module deploys an AWS auto-scaling group for a cluster of web servers.  The ASG is able to do a rolling deployment whenever any of its properties change.

## Quick Start

Modules are not intended to be deployed directly, instead they should be included in other Terraform configurations.
